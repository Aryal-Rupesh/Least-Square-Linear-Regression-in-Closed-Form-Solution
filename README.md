This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using the closed-form solution. The closed-form solution provides a direct way to compute the optimal parameters of the linear regression model by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. To get started, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the example script to see the model in action. The closed-form solution calculates the parameters using the formula Î¸ = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T Y, leveraging SymPy for matrix operations.
